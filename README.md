# Simon-Game
A fun and interactive memory-based game inspired by the classic Simon Game! Test your ability to recall and repeat sequences of colors and sounds as the difficulty progressively increases. I built this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I think this project is perfect for practicing my front-end development skills and game logic.
